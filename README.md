 libft - library at forty-two
</h1>


### ðŸŒ• What is libft ?

Libft is an individual project at [42 Tokyo][1] to re-create some standard C library functions,  which will be very useful to get familiar with memory allocation and data structures.

### ðŸŒ• What's in it ?

There are 4 types of code:

1.  **Libc Functions:** Some of the standard C functions
2.  **Additional functions:** Functions that will be useful for later projects
3.  **Bonus Functions:** Functions that will be useful for linked list manipulation
4.  **Personal Functions:** Functions I believe will be useful later.
